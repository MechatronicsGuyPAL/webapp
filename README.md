CDA project files - initial github push 7/4/17
Author Philip Long

This project was a part of my final year thesis. It was intended to use crowdsourced volunteers to evaluate crater predictions on pictures of Mars.
This project was used on an Ubuntu cloud server with python 2.7.

The following tutorials were used to set up the server.

The 'images' directory used for storing the crater images is not included in this project because of the large file size.
That directory needs to be added to webapp/app/static/images
